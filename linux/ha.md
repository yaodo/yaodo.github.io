  HeartBeat的心跳连接
两台heartbeat主机之间通信的一些常用的可行的方法：

1. 串行电缆，即所谓的串口（首选，缺点是距离不能太远）

2. 一根以太网电缆两网卡直连（生产环境中常用的方式）

3. 以太网电缆，通过交换机等网络设备连接（次选，原因是增加了故障点，不好排查故障，同时，线路不是专用的心跳线，容易受其他数据传输的影响，导致心跳报文发送问题） 
服务可以采用httpd 80端口测试，注意关闭iptables

#	auto_failback:  determines whether a resource will
#	automatically fail back to its "primary" node, or remain
#	on whatever node is serving it until that node fails, or
#	an administrator intervenes.
#
#	The possible values for auto_failback are:
#		on	- enable automatic failbacks
#		off	- disable automatic failbacks
#		legacy	- enable automatic failbacks in systems
#			where all nodes do not yet support
#			the auto_failback option.
#
#	auto_failback "on" and "off" are backwards compatible with
#		"nice_failback on" setting.
#
#	See the FAQ for information on how to convert
#		from "legacy" to "on" without a flash cut.
#		(i.e., using a "rolling upgrade" process)
#
#	The default value for auto_failback is "legacy", which
#	will issue a warning at startup.  So, make sure you put
#	an auto_failback directive in your ha.cf file.
#	(note: auto_failback can be any boolean or "legacy")

#       Basic STONITH support
#       Using this directive assumes that there is one stonith 
#       device in the cluster.  Parameters to this device are

#
#         stonith <stonith_type> <configfile>

#       cluster!

#       You can configure multiple stonith devices using this dire
#       The format of the line is:
#         stonith_host <hostfrom> <stonith_type> <params...>
#         <hostfrom> is the machine the stonith device is attached
#              to or * to mean it is accessible from any host. 
#         <stonith_type> is the type of stonith device (a list of
#              supported drives is in /usr/lib/stonith.)
#         <params...> are driver specific parameters.  To see the
#              format for a particular device, run:
#           stonith -l -t <stonith_type> 
#
#
#	Note that if you put your stonith device access informatio
#	here, and you make this file publically readable, you're a
#	for a denial of service attack ;-)

#	an orderly shutdown of heartbeat will trigger a reboot, wh
